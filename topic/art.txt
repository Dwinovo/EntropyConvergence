Art translates ideas into sensuous form and shared experience. Today its materials span performance, installation, bio-art, data visualization, and algorithmic/generative media, expanding modes of authorship and collaboration. Participatory and public practices foreground community, care, and justice, while global exchange diversifies styles and canons. Curatorial and archival infrastructures shape visibility and value. As tools become computational, artists probe bias, authorship, and sustainability, using experimentation to question how technology reconfigures perception, memory, and cultural narratives.
