AI development is currently in a phase of rapid acceleration, primarily driven by large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. These technologies are not only creating text, images, and code but are also beginning to empower scientific research and industrial design. Major tech companies and startups are investing heavily, rapidly advancing model scale and capabilities. Consequently, AI applications are expanding across all industries, from office automation to autonomous driving. This widespread integration has also brought issues of AI ethics, safety, and governance to the forefront of global discussion.
