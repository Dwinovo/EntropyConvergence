Philosophy investigates foundational questions about reality, knowledge, mind, language, value, and reason. Core areas include metaphysics (being, causation, modality), epistemology (evidence, justification, skepticism), philosophy of mind (consciousness, intentionality), philosophy of language (meaning, reference, pragmatics), logic (valid inference, formal systems), ethics (well-being, duty, rights), and political philosophy (justice, authority, legitimacy). Methods range from conceptual analysis and formal modeling to phenomenology and historical inquiry. Contemporary work interfaces with AI, neuroscience, economics, and the social sciences to clarify concepts, evaluate arguments and evidence, and guide rational decision-making under uncertainty.
